# Feature Selection

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Feature selection is an essential step in preparing our dataset for machine learning models. The goal is to:
- **Remove redundant or highly correlated features** that introduce noise.
- **Ensure model interpretability** by selecting the most relevant features.
- **Handle collinearity** to avoid multicollinearity issues that can affect model stability.

## ðŸ”¹ Planned Steps
1. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) Analysis**  
   - Identify and remove highly correlated features to prevent multicollinearity.
   - Drop features with **VIF > 5**, indicating redundancy.

2. **Feature Importance Evaluation Using SHAP**  
   - Use SHAP values to determine the most predictive variables based on their impact on the target variable.

3. **Final Feature Set Selection**  
   - Retain only the **most relevant and independent** features based on VIF and SHAP analysis.

## ðŸ“Š Final Selected Features
After applying **VIF analysis and SHAP feature importance**, we have removed redundant and less important features. The final selected features are:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **NT**  | Normalizing Temperature |
| **Ct**  | Carburization Time |
| **Dt**  | Diffusion Time |
| **QmT** | Quenching Media Temperature |
| **TT**  | Tempering Temperature |
| **C**   | Carbon Content |
| **Si**  | Silicon Content |
| **Mn**  | Manganese Content |
| **P**   | Phosphorus Content |
| **Cr**  | Chromium Content |
| **Mo**  | Molybdenum Content |
| **RedRatio** | Reduction Ratio (Ingot to Bar) |
| **dA**  | Area Proportion of Inclusions Deformed by Plastic Work |

These features represent the **most important predictors** for **fatigue strength** while avoiding multicollinearity issues.

### **ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways**
1. **High VIF features removed:** `Tt, THt, TCr, CT, THT, DT` (multicollinearity issue).
2. **Low SHAP importance features removed:** `THQCr, S, Ni, Cu, dB, dC` (low impact on prediction).
3. **Final features are well-balanced between material composition and processing conditions.**

### **ðŸ“Œ Next Steps**
âœ… **Apply feature transformations (scaling, normalization, etc.)**  
âœ… **Prepare dataset for model training and evaluation.**  

We are now ready to move to **outlier treatment and feature transformations** before building the predictive model. ðŸš€
